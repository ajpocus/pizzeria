README for Pizzeria, a Django project

SUMMARY

	Pizzeria is a group of Django apps for placing and viewing orders in a
    pizza restaurant. There are currently two apps, order and line, which place
    and show orders, respectively.

REQUIREMENTS

	Pizzeria was built using Django 1.2.5, Python 2.7.1, and 
    django-debug-toolbar 0.8.4. Most Unix-based systems come with Python pre-
    installed, although you may need to use the python2 executable if your
    distro uses python3. Most distros should also have a Django package. As for
    django-debug-toolbar, you can install it with pip, as in:

    sudo pip install django-debug-toolbar

    If you don't have pip, there are packages available.

USAGE

	From the root project directory, you can run:

    python manage.py runserver

    to start the Django development server. It's bare-bones right now, but apps
    are available at localhost:8000/order and /line. The order app provides
    a basic order and recipt interface, while the line shows order not yet
    made. An interface to clear orders is yet to come on the line app.
